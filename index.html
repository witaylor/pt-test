      ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for testing my posture analysis app!
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      Please note that this is an early proof of concept. There are some
      features that are missing, and others may not work as intended.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      On the next page, you will be prompted to upload an image. It will then be
      analysed and your pose will be estimated. Right now, the app won't give
      you any information on your posture but will mark 'landmarks' on your
      body, such as your shoulders and hips.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the best results, make sure that these landmarks are easily visible.
      Avoid wearing long and/or baggy clothing.
    </p>

    <div
      class="bg-yellow-200 rounded border-l-8 border-yellow-400 px-2 py-1 my-4"

      <p>
        By default, your image will never be stored and will only be visible to
        you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-4">
      You may allow us to save your image for analytical purposes by ticking the
      checkbox on the next page. In this case, your image will be securely
      stored, only visible to the sole developer of this app, and will only be
      used to test the accuracy of the pose estimation model.
